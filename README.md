How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The best way to create maintainabble, readable, and adaptable code is to follow standard coding practices and OOP guidelines. The advantage of using a CRUD module to handle database interactions was that it abstracted Mongodb functionality into a more controlled format. If users were given direct access to the Mongodb database, they would be able to make a wider variety of queries and changes to the dataset, but they would also need to learn mongo syntax. With the crud controller I was able to scope the Dashboard to the specifics needs of the user, which simultaneously increased data safety and removed the need for users to understand a specific resource. 


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

My typical coding approach is to allow user requirements to guide my design, but I found this approach ineffective when working on the Grazioso Salvare project. Based on my personal expereince with Python and Dash Framework, neither should ever be used when constructing databases for clients. Dash components do not work properly and several of the plotly dash coding examples were inoperable. If I build databases in the future, I hope to have better software at my disposal.
